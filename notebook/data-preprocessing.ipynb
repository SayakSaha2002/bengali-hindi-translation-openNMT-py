Word-based tokenization used to be the way to go; in this case, each word would be a token. However, an MT model can only learn a specific number of vocabulary tokens due to limited hardware resources. To solve this issue, sub-words are used instead of whole words. At translation time, when the model sees a new word/token that looks like a word/token it has in the vocabulary, it still can try to continue the translation instead of marking this word as “unknown” or “unk”.\n","\n","There are a few approaches to sub-wording such as BPE and the unigram model. One of the famous toolkits that incorporates the most common approaches is SentencePiece. Note that you have to train a sub-wording model and then use it.
